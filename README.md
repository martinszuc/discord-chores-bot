## Advanced Features

### Chore Difficulty and Assignment Balancing

Chores can have difficulty ratings from 1 to 5 stars. The bot uses these ratings to balance the workload when assigning chores:

1. Chores are assigned in order of difficulty (highest first)
2. The flatmate with the lowest total difficulty so far gets assigned the next chore
3. Flatmates who skip chores often get higher priority for future assignments
4. Flatmates who recently returned from vacation get priority for easier chores

### Vacation Mode

Flatmates can enable vacation mode to be excluded from chore assignments:

- Use `/chores vacation status:True` to enable vacation mode
- Use `/chores vacation status:False` to disable vacation mode
- When returning from vacation, flatmates get a boost in priority for easier chores

### Next Week Planning

The `/chores next_week` command allows you to plan who will be included in the next chore rotation:

1. A message with all active flatmates will be displayed
2. React with the number emoji next to a flatmate to toggle their inclusion/exclusion
3. Exclusions are temporary and will be cleared after the next schedule is generated

### Automated Reminders

The bot can send automatic reminders for pending chores:

- Configure reminder settings with `/choresadmin reminders`
- Set the day and time when reminders should be sent
- Flatmates will be reminded of chores they haven't completed yet

### Viewing Logs

If you're running with Docker:

```bash
docker logs -f discord-chores-bot
```

If you're running directly with Python:

```bash
tail -f bot.log
```
